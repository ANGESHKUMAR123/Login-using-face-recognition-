# 🔐 Face Recognition Based Login System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **secure login system using face recognition** instead of traditional passwords.
It enhances website security by preventing fake, bot, and unauthorized logins.

## 🎯 Objective

To replace username-password authentication with **biometric face authentication** using a webcam.

## 🧠 Key Features

* Face-based login authentication
* Face registration module
* Multiple user support
* Real-time face capture via webcam
* High security against password attacks
* User-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
